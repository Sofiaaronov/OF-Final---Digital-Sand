For my final project I wanted to produce an idea I've had for long time. I'd like to reproduce digitally and the game of the "sand disc". 
It is a disc covered in sand and rotating constantly: by placing a finger on the disc, and moving it sligthly in a costant rythm it is possible to create beautiful symmetrical patterns.

My bigger idea is to greate a phisical installation composed of a small circular platform where the user can place objects and move them. the platfom should be semitransparent and it should containt a light and a camera. This way the shadow contours of the objects would be detected and then projected into a big projection in front of the user and, at the same time, rotated around the center of the composition. This would recreate the effect of the rotating sand disc, adding the possibility to create incredible, different patterns in base of the kind of object chosen and its movement. Furthermore the user could control speed of rotation, appearance, diameter, color and much more.

I have started my experimentation with ofxOpenCV to detect the contours of object and then reprint them on the rotating screen but the process revealed to be more complicated so I decided to do one step at a time.
Thus I created an openFrameworks sketch wich works whith mouse interaction instead of a real, phisical approach.

The sketch works really well and gives out a strong sensation of what the project is about. It is my intention now to bring forward this piece to accomplish my initial idea involving physical interaction.

What I've learnt with this project:

* use of Triginometry
* ofxOpenCV
* ofxGUI
